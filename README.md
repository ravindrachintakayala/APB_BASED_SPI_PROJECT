# APB Based SPI Protocol Project

## Project Aim
This project designs and implements a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) controller with an Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) slave interface. The goal is to enable efficient and modular communication between APB bus systems and SPI-compatible peripherals, facilitating seamless data transfer in embedded systems.

## Detailed Project Description
The SPI protocol is a widely-used synchronous serial communication method that connects a master device to one or more slaves using clock, data, and slave select lines. The APB bus is a standard protocol in system-on-chip architectures for accessing low-bandwidth peripherals.

This project merges these two concepts by developing an SPI controller that functions as an APB slave. This allows commands, configurations, and data to flow from the processor via APB to the SPI interface, enabling interaction with external SPI slave devices efficiently and reliably.
